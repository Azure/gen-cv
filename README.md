### Getting Started
The code within this repository has been tested on both __Github Codespaces__ compute and an __Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance__. Although the use of a GPU is not a requirement, it is highly recommended if you aim to generate a large number of sample images using Stable Diffusion.

Follow these steps to get started:

1.  Clone this repository on your preferred compute using the following command:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/gen-cv.git
```

2. Create your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies. For our development, we utilized Conda. You can do the same with these commands:

```bash
conda create -n gen-cv python=3.10
conda activate gen-cv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. From the list provided above, select a sample notebook. After making your selection, configure the Jupyter notebook to use the kernel associated with the environment you set up in Step 2.
4. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` to store your parameters:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
5. Add the required parameters and keys for your services to the `.env` file.
