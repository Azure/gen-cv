    "1. __Export slides as high-resolution images__: PowerPoint allows you to export slides as images. For optimal results, we recommend exporting the slides as 1920x1080 PNG files. You can follow this brief tutorial on how to do so: [Export slides as 1920x1080 PNGs](https://youtu.be/Cv7vGce25rs).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternatively __export the entire presentation as an MP4 video__: If you prefer to use a video instead of static images, PowerPoint offers the option to export your whole animated presentation as an MP4 file.  Here's how you can do it:  \n",
    "Go to __File__ > __Export__ > __Create a Video__ in PowerPoint. Use slide transition and animation durations to adjust timings. The best way to align avatar and content video timing is to use a video editor (Option 2)\n",

    "\n",

    "### Option 1: Use the FFmpeg command line \n",
