Hello, I am Lisa. Let me show you how to create an engaging avatar video in four steps.<break strength="x-strong" />
It begins with a talking script for your avatar. You can get started with a text file. However, we recommend to use the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) for advanced requirements.
It allows you to fine-tune the voice of your avatar including pronounciation or the expression of special terms. Also, you can add avatar gestures like pointing to an item.
The Audio Content Creation tool of the Speech Studio provides an intuitive user interface to create an input file for the process.<break strength="x-strong" />
With your talking script ready, you can use the Azure Text to Speech API to synthesize your avatar video. 
Besides providing the SSML input you can specify the character and style of the avatar (such as standing or sitting) and the video format. 
Our Jupyter notebook will guide you through these steps in detail.<break strength="x-strong" />
In many cases, you probably want to add a content video with text, illustrations, animations etc. to the final avatar video.
Our toolset guides you on exporting an animated PowerPoint presentation as a high-resolution video for this purpose.<break strength="x-strong" />
Finally, you combine the avatar video, content, and optional elements like background music to compose a rich video experience.
This can either be done using the FFmpeg tool or a video editor like ClipChamp for more control. 
Using a video editor provides an intuitive way to fine-tune the timings of the video and adding effects and animations.<break strength="x-strong" />
We can't wait to see what you will create!<break strength="x-strong" /></voice></speak>
